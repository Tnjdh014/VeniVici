This web app: **Displays random cat images using axios api**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [ ] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**

## Notes

I couldnt implement a ban list since that is way out of my timeframe and brainpower, Learning APIs took way too much time to learn so i settled with this random cat generator

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
